	<p><i>CodeScale</i> is an experiment to determine the cognitive weights of basic control structures in imperative programming languages based on user perception and response times.</p>
	<p>The experiment comprises the following stages:
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>Practice Sessions:</b> this helps participants get up to speed with basic java control structures. Participants are presented with code snippets in Java and their corresponding output.</li>
		<li><b>Main Activity:</b> at this stage, participants will be presented with Java code snippets and will be required to provide the expected output via a text input field.</li>
		<li><b>Survey:</b> A brief survey will be presented to the participant.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>In order to ensure the accuracy of the experiment, please ensure that you do not get distracted or interrupted while working on a code snippet. You can take breaks in between activities/code snippets</p>
	
	<p><strong>You may use a pen and paper to help you work through the code snippets.<strong></p>
